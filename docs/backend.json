    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to facilitate a secure and scalable inventory management system for the Sahachari Resource Tracker application. It emphasizes authorization independence through denormalization and structural segregation for clarity and security. The structure uses path-based ownership for user-related data and the membership map pattern for collaborative access where needed.\n\n**Authorization Independence:**  No `get()` calls are required in security rules.  The `items` collection itself doesn't require an `ownerId` or `members` field, as public read access is permitted. The `issuedItems` subcollection includes denormalized fields like the `itemId` to allow for rules to ensure issues are valid and that reporting occurs.  Admin roles are managed through the `roles_admin` collection. This eliminates hierarchical authorization checks, ensuring atomic operations are possible.\n\n**Structural Segregation:** The design separates data with different security postures into distinct collections. The `items` collection is public read, admin write; whereas `/roles_admin` is a secure existence-based admin role check. There is no mixing of public and private data.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure facilitates secure `list` operations by ensuring all documents within a collection share the same security requirements. Public `list` access to `/items` is safe because all items are intended to be readable by all users. Admin `list` access can be secured via DBAC in the `roles_admin` collection."
